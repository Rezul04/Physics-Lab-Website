        Dr. Bharti Singh is currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Physics at Delhi Technological University (DTU). She holds a Ph.D. in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, earned between 2008 and 2014, under the supervision of Prof. B. R. Mehta. Her doctoral research focused on the “Structural and electronic properties of copper oxide-based hybrid and nanoscale resistive memory devices.” Prior to her Ph.D., she completed her Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Physics with a specialization in Electronics from Delhi University between 2005 and 2007, and a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Physics (Hons.) from Miranda House College, Delhi University (2002–2005). Her undergraduate project was titled "Password enabled obstacle sensing robot."

Her research interests span a broad range of areas including thin films science and technology, two-dimensional layered materials and their van der Waals heterostructures, flexible and wearable nanoelectronics devices, metal-oxide interface properties, resistive random access memory devices, flexible nanogenerators for energy harvesting, and sensors.

Dr. Singh has achieved an H-index of 15, with 652 citations and 19 publications indexed under the i10 metric. She is a life member of various prestigious societies such as the Electron Microscope Society of India (EMSI), Indian Science Congress Association, Materials Research Society of India (MRSI), and Indian Association of Physics Teachers. She has been the recipient of numerous awards including the SERB-SURE research grant (2023), AICTE-SPICES Grant (2021), UGC-Start-up Grant (2017), DST-INSPIRE Faculty Award (2017), and National Postdoctoral Fellowship (2017). Additionally, she received the Distinction in Doctoral Research Award from IIT Delhi (2016), and held both Junior (2008–2010) and Senior Research Fellowships (2010–2013) from CSIR. She also qualified GATE in 2008.
